### Hi There :octocat:

My name is Damien.

Iâ€™m a web application software engineer, devops, UNIX system administrator, UI/UX designer, electricity enthusiast, speaker and a creator of Baythium Ecosystem.

### Technology Stack

I tend to specialize in:

- **JavaScript**
- **Python**
- **Rust**
- **Bash**
- **PowerShell**
- **Go** programming and scripting languages.

### Status

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Baythium Ecosystem and government IT projects.

### Workflow

I really like using Python along with Flask and Django frameworks that accelerate my productivity as never before, however if there is really no need to use either a library or framework, then I donâ€™t. Frankly, I donâ€™t like to complicate things with 3rd party libraries and I tend to solve the problems using custom solutions and methods.

Concurrently, my skill set includes working with banking, online shops, content management systems, customer relationship management and developing and working with API web-services (micro-services), creation and optimization of scalable websites, search engine optimization (SEO) and others.

As I said earlier, Iâ€™m fond of all kinda development activities but a front-end is my primary thrust to which Iâ€™m deeply committed. For this, I constantly seek to something new in my own time for personal interest because I love developing for the web using modern technologies like Vue, React and Angular, building communities, contributing 
to open source, creating awesome web apps and IoT devices; when Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me reading, blogging, training for races and etc.

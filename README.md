### Workflow

> Ye know, I really like usin' JavaScript, Python, Go 'n Rust along with cuttin'-edge frameworks that accelerate my productivity as never before, however if there's no need to use either a library or framework, then I donâ€™t. Frankly, I donâ€™t like to complicate things with 3rd party libraries 'n I tend to solve the problems usin' custom solutions 'n methods cos it allows ye to think through all of the details 'n principles of yer business
>
> As I said earlier, I'm fond of all kinda development activities but a front-end's my primary thrust to which I'm deeply committed. For this, I constantly seek to somethin' new in my own time for personal interest cos I love developin' for the web usin' modern technologies like **React**, **Vue** 'n **Svelte**, buildin' communities, contributin' 
to open source, creatin' awesome web 'n native apps in addition to IoT devices; when I'm not codin', you'll probably find me readin', bloggin', trainin' for races 'n etc.
